                <h3>America First</h3>
                <p>A policy position that emphasizes prioritizing American citizens, workers, and interests above international obligations. In conservative politics, it typically refers to a nationalist approach to foreign policy, trade, and immigration that gained prominence during the Trump administration. Critics of RINOs often cite lack of commitment to America First principles as evidence of Republican politicians not adhering to party values.</p>
